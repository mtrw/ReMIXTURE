Description: Regionwise similarity plots for collections of objects with known 
    inter-object distances and some 'region' property, using a method of resampling and heirarchical clustering. An earlier version of this method is described in Rabanus-Wallace & Tripodi et al. (2021), this newer version differs significantly, with the algorithm updated to give much more intuitively interpretable results.
