Description: 
    Implementation of the ReMIXTURE method to create pretty and intuitive plots showing how (genetic or other) diversity is distributed and shared between regions of the globe. An earlier version of this method is described in Rabanus-Wallace & Tripodi et al. (2021), this newer version differs significantly, with the algorithm updated to give much more intuitively interpretable results.
