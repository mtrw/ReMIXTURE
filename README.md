# ReMIXTURE

A newer version of the ReMIXTURE method whose concept was first attempted in Rabanus-Wallace & Tripodi et al. (2021) Global range expansion history of pepper (Capsicum spp.) revealed by over 10,000 genebank accessions. PNAS August 24, 2021 118 (34) e2104315118; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2104315118; https://www.pnas.org/content/118/34/e2104315118 (But please use sci-hub if possible)

This version overcomes several sources of bias that risk producing unintuitive results in the initial version. It also runs a lot faster and makes prettier graphs. New features will include proper vignettes with a clear method description, more control over the plot output, tools to explore the influence of algorithm parameters and set them in a more standardised way, and more checks and bug fixes.
