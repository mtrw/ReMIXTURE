# ReMIXTURE

WARNING: A newer version of the ReMIXTURE method has been developed that greatly improves the method's tolerance of sampling biases, produces more intuitive results, and runs much faster. This message will be removed on initial commit of the newer version, once it has been implemented as an R package. If you are reading this and intend on using ReMIXTURE, please email Tim (mtrw85@gmail.com) to discuss running the new version instead.
